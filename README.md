# COVID-19 self-help resources

Mainly focusing on the UK, London, Camden, but we'll see over time.

**Note**: instead of checking this list, likely https://covidmutualaid.org/ is
a better place to look, as possibly more up to date.

## Camden (London) mutual assistance groups

Camden Whatsapp groups for multual assistance ([original post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/199172994722225/permalink/199896187983239/))

Please join the whatapp group below for ward in which you will be able to help (most likely where you live)
(You can find out which ward you're in here: https://www.camden.gov.uk/find-your-ward-and-ward-map)
Note: it may take a few days for the groups to get active and organised as each group grows.

(For best experience, open the link on your smartphone, so Whatsapp can be opened easily)
